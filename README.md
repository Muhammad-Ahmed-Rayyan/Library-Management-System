## 📚 Overview

The **Library Management System** is a simple yet powerful desktop application built with Python, Tkinter, and SQLite.  
It provides an intuitive graphical interface to manage a library's inventory, issue and return books, and maintain records.

Key features include:

- 📖 **Book Inventory:** Add, view, update, and delete book records easily.
- 💳 **Issue & Return:** Track the status of books (Available/Issued) and link them to an issuer card ID.
- 🔍 **Search & Selection:** Quickly find and view detailed information of any book.
- 🗑️ **Full or Partial Delete:** Remove individual records or clear the entire inventory.
- 🎨 **Interactive GUI:** Built with Tkinter for a smooth user experience.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

`git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Ahmed-Rayyan/Library-Management-System.git
cd Library-Management-System`


2. **Install Python (if not already installed):**
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

3. **Run the application:**


When you run `library.py`, it will automatically create a local SQLite database file `library.db` (if it doesn't exist) and initialize it with some sample book records.

## 🗄️ Database

This project uses **SQLite** to store all data locally in a file named `library.db`.  
- All book information, their status (Available / Issued), and associated card IDs are saved here.
- No external database setup is required — it runs completely offline.
